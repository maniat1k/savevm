SaveVM

// Make a savestate solution on VirtualBox's VMS before the host go poweroff.

The idea is to make a simple solution to prevent Virtual Machines to shutdown when the host is going down: Try to save them before that happens.

// TODO list
- Add small base script (bash).
- Work around with systemctl on OpenSUSE.
