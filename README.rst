SaveVM
======

A savestate solution on VirtualBox's VMS before the host go poweroff.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The idea is to make a simple solution to prevent Virtual Machines to shutdown or break when the host is going down.
Try to save them before that happens...

TODO list
~~~~~~~~~~

* Add small base script (bash). (added)
* Work around with systemctl on OpenSUSE. (in progress)
