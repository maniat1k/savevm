SaveVM
======

A solution on VirtualBox's VMS before the host go poweroff.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The idea is to make a simple solution to prevent Virtual Machines to shutdown or break when the host is going down.
Try to save them before that happens...

TODO list
~~~~~~~~~~

* Add small base script (bash). (added)
* Work around with systemd on OpenSUSE: You can read about it here: http://www.forosuse.org/forosuse/showpost.php?p=164799&postcount=4 (is in spanish) I will put it in the wiki to star it clean.
* Add service code here.
